Today, there is a lot of criticism regarding our current economic system. In fact, this has always been the case. There has always been something inherent in economics that keeps people sceptical of it and renders it something inhumane. Perhaps it begins with the trading of people, that is to think of others as slaves. Perhaps it has to do with its ability to give greed free rein. A motive that has sparked conquests and inspired colonialism. Or perhaps it is its ability to steer us away from the simplicity of nature. An impulse that is becoming more rare. Whatever criticism we have of the economic system in general, we must at least agree on a definition of what it is. 

Often it is helpful to look at some precedent as a deliberate solution to an underlying problem. It clarifies its existence and gives us a more emphatic understanding of the convention. For example, whatever we may say about money, money solves a particular problem. It exists by virtue of the fact that we experience this problem and the fact that money solves it. Those criteria alone guarantee its existence. To eliminate money then means we have to either avoid facing the problem or come up with a different solution to the problem. Any attempt to change a convention can similarly be classified in this way.

Corneo takes a hint in the Greek word "oikonomos", namely management of household affairs. A household faces two fundamental problems consistently in varying forms. There are various tasks that must be performed by the family. First, they must be motivated to do the tasks together. Second, they must decide how to allocate scarce resources such that the tasks are done effectively. 

Heilbroner takes the unifying question to be how man earns his daily bread or how he divides it among his brethren. He contrasts our contemporary economic system (eg. in the US) with hunter gatherer societies (eg. Inuit, Native Americans, etc.) and identifies that we are characteristically helpless due to the division of labour. It is a trade-off. We have gains in output but lose our independence from others. He says

"When we turn to the New Yorker or the Chicagoan, on the other hand, we are struck by exactly the opposite condition, by a prevailing ease of material life coupled with an extreme dependence on others. We can no longer envisage the solitary individual or the small community surviving unaided in the great metropolitan areas where most Americans live, unless they loot warehouses or stores for food and necessities. The over­ whelming majority of Americans have never grown food, caught game, raised meat, ground grain into flour, or even fashioned flour into bread. Faced with the challenge of clothing themselves or building their own homes, they would be hopelessly untrained and unprepared. Even to make minor repairs in the machines that surround them, they must call on other members of the commu­ nity whose business it is to fix cars or repair plumbing or whatever. Paradoxically, perhaps, the richer the nation, the more apparent is this inability of its average inhabitant to survive unaided and alone."

An economic system must solve two tasks:
- (Generate output) Organise a system to assure the production of enough goods and services for its own survival ie. to come up with institutions that mobilise effort for productive ends and allocate the effort such that they effectively accomplish the given ends.
- (Distribute output) Arrange the distribution of output so that more production can take place. 

Cassel gives the most comprehensive exposition on this topic. In three chapters, he defines what an economic system is, how money fits into the picture and how it works thereafter. Like Debreu after him, Cassel came to economics from mathematics. He gives a pretty good overview of the whole economic system and the processes it includes and I have memorised the main parts of his argument, or rather they seem to have been firmly impressed on me. He gives the necessary frame that motivates and provides context for the all of economics. Something contemporary textbooks fail at doing quite remarkably and consistently. He assumes little and looks at it rather generally. In effect, you get a sense of what are the building blocks by which an economic system is built from. 

Cassel makes all the points Heilbroner and Corneo raise. 

An economic system must be effective, sustainable and just. We have more or less succeeded in developing an effective economic system but it is clear that we repeatedly fail at developing one that is sustainable and just. 

In the end, it comes down to a few choices we must make and live the consequences of. We have a problem and we must choose the solution we believe best solves it and live with the consequences of that choice. That is a political choice open to everyone, not a choice left solely with the expert, be it the economist or civil servant.
